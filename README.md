# CS 328 Final Project

## Fall Detection
Our project will be about Fall Detection, specifically to build a classifier to distinguish between falls and other safe activities. Falling is one of the major causes of serious injuries such as fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and death, especially with the elderly population, it is very important to be able to detect falling quickly and accurately. Distinguishing between falling and other safe activities could be useful to help alert authorities when a fall is detected, which is particularly important and could be life-saving for elderly people or people with medical conditions - those who are at highest risk for physiological harm from falls. 

# File Structure
The file 328FinalProject.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the Data Preprocessing and Filtering, Feature Extraction, and Modeling & Evaluation sections. The data folder contains subfolders with all the recorded activities (sorted in folders by activity and labelled with each of our names within each folder). features_for_model.csv is the file created from our code that extracts the time domain features from the recorded activities based on 5-second windows.
