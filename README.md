## Fall Detection
Our project will be about Fall Detection, specifically to build a classifier to distinguish between falls and other safe activities. Falling is one of the major causes of serious injuries such as fractures, traumatic brain injuries, and death, especially with the elderly population, it is very important to be able to detect falling quickly and accurately. Distinguishing between falling and other safe activities could be useful to help alert authorities when a fall is detected, which is particularly important and could be life-saving for elderly people or people with medical conditions - those who are at highest risk for physiological harm from falls.
